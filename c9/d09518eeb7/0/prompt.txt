hello

---

look at my selected text, is this the correct way to lazy load punkt tab?

---

granite_core/granite_core/citations/citations.py line 153

---

ok sounds good

---

I want to modify the dockerfiles in the a2a folder to include the punkt tab download in the image, the same way as I did in the acp/Dockerfile

---

dont you also need to set the nltk data flah in the runner?

---

make sure that is the correct path, look at the dockerfile in the acp folder

---

ok now build the agent dockerfile and run it

---

ok now create a shell into the container and try to import the punktokenizer

---

no you have to initialze the tokenizer and tokize a string

---

no create an instance of PunktSentenceTokenizer and use the sent_tokenize

---
